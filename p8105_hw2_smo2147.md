# Problem 1

#### Cleaning the National Politician Dataset

``` r
pls_month_df =
  read_csv("./Data/FiveThirtyEight/pols-month.csv", na = c("NA", ".", "")) |> 
  janitor::clean_names() |> 
  separate(mon, sep = "-", into = c("year", "month", "day")) |>
  mutate(across(year:day, as.integer),
         month = factor(month,
                        levels = 1:12,
                        labels = tolower(month.abb))) |> 
  mutate(president = case_when(
         prez_gop == 1 ~ "gop",
         prez_gop == 0 ~ "dem",
         TRUE ~ NA_character_ )) |> 
  relocate(year, month, president) |> 
  select(-day, -prez_gop, -prez_dem) |> 
  arrange(year, month)
```

#### Cleaning the Stock Market Index Dataset

``` r

  mutate(
    across(month:year, as.integer),
    year = ifelse(year 
                  <= 49, year + 2000, 
                  year + 1900),
    month = factor(month, 
                   levels = 1:12, 
                   labels = tolower(month.abb))) |>

    names_to = "month",
    values_to = "unemp_rate") |> 
  mutate(
    year = as.integer(year),
    month = factor(month,
                   levels = tolower(month.abb))) |> 
  arrange(year, month) |> 
  relocate(year, month)
```

#### Merging National Politician, Stock Market, and Unemployment Datasets

``` r

  left_join(pls_month_df, stock_market_df, by = c("year", "month")) |>
  left_join(unemp_df, by = c("year", "month")) |> 
  arrange(year, month)
```

#### Explanation of Politician, Stock Market, and Unemployment Datasets

###### Description of National Democratic and Republic Politician Dataset

To start with dataset **`pls_month_df`**, it contains information about
national politicians who are either democratic or republican across
across time. The dataset originally had the **`mon`** variable,
indicating the date of count, which I separated into columns **`year`**,
**`month`**, and **`day`** using the **`separate`** function. It also
had two variables, **`prez_gop`** and **`prez_dem`**, indicating whether
sitting president was republican or democratic on the associated date of
count, which I mutated into a new variable called **`president`**. After
tidying the dataset, the dataset was left with **822** observations and
**9** variables. The range of years for national politicians goes from
**1947** to **2015**, which tell us the year of observation. Along with
the **`year`** variable, we get more information from the **`month`**
and **`president`** variables, which also indicate the month of
observation and indication of whether the president was republican or
democratic at the time of observation. The remaining variables in this
dataset gives us information about republican and democratic
representatives, governors, and senators on the associated year and
month of observation.

###### Description of Standard & Poor’s Stock Market Index Dataset

The **`stock_market_df`** dataset contains information about the market
index, which gives you a representative measure of the stock market at
the time of observation. The dataset originally had the **`date`**
variable, indicating the date of observation, which I separated into
columns **`year`**, **`month`**, and **`day`** using the **`separate`**
function. After tidying the dataset, the dataset was left with **787**
observations and **3** variables. The range of years for the closing
values of the S&P stock index goes from **1950** to **2015**, which tell
us the year of observation. These variable basically gives us insight on
the closing values of the stock market index based on the associated
date, as depicted by the **`close`** variable at the end of the
**`year`** and **`month`** observations.

###### Description of Unemployment Rate Dataset

As for the **`unemp_df`** dataset, it contains information about the
unemployment rate on the associated year and month. The dataset
originally had the number of months as variables, ranging from **`jan`**
to **`dec`**, along with the **`year`** variable, totaling **68**
observations with **13** variables total. I used the **`pivot_longer`**
function to reshape my dataframe from wide to long, creating a new
variable called **`month`** and gathering the unemployment rates
observations paired with the corresponding month and year of observation
on the associated date. After tidying the dataset, the dataset was left
with **816** observations and **3** variables. The range of years for
unemployment rates go from **1948** to **2015**, which tell us the
associated year and month on the observed rate.

###### Description of Merged Politician, Stock Market, and Unemployment Datasets

Lastly, we merged the politician, stock market, and employment datasets
described above using the **`left_join`** function for the combined
dataset **`pls_snp_unemp_df`**. After merging these datasets, we get a
year range from **1947** to **2015**. It also contains **822**
observations and **11** variables. Key variables that are important to
this merged dataset include the **`year`**, **`month`**,
**`president`**, **`close`**, and **`unemp_rate`** variables, which
provides a big picture overview of what the closing values of the stock
market and unemployment rates were for each sitting president, either
democratic or republican on the associated year and month.
