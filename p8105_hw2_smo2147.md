# Problem 1

#### Cleaning the `pols-month.csv` dataset

``` r
pls_month_df =
  read_csv("./Data/FiveThirtyEight/pols-month.csv", na = c("NA", ".", "")) |> 
  janitor::clean_names() |> 
  separate(mon, sep = "-", into = c("year", "month", "day")) |>
  mutate(across(year:day, as.integer),
         month = factor(month,
                        levels = 1:12,
                        labels = tolower(month.abb))) |> 
  mutate(president = case_when(
         prez_gop == 1 ~ "gop",
         prez_gop == 0 ~ "dem",
         TRUE ~ NA_character_ )) |> 
  relocate(year, month, president) |> 
  select(-day, -prez_gop, -prez_dem) |> 
  arrange(year, month)
```

#### Cleaning the `snp.csv` dataset

``` r
stock_market_df =
  read_csv("./Data/FiveThirtyEight/snp.csv", na = c("NA", ".", "")) |> 
  janitor::clean_names() |> 
  separate(date, sep = "/", into = c("month", "day", "year")) |> 
  mutate(
    across(month:year, as.integer),
    year = ifelse(year 
                  <= 49, year + 2000, 
                  year + 1900),
    month = factor(month, 
                   levels = 1:12, 
                   labels = tolower(month.abb))) |> 
  relocate(year) |> 
  select(-day) |> 
  arrange(year, month)
```

#### Tidying the `umeployment` dataset

``` r
unemp_df =
  read_csv("./Data/FiveThirtyEight/unemployment.csv", na = c("NA", ".", "")) |> 
  janitor::clean_names() |> 
  pivot_longer(
    jan:dec,
    names_to = "month",
    values_to = "unemp_rate") |> 
  mutate(
    year = as.integer(year),
    month = factor(month,
                   levels = tolower(month.abb))) |> 
  arrange(year, month)
```

#### Merging `snp`, `pols` and `unemployment` datasets

``` r
pls_snp_unemp_df =
  left_join(pls_month_df, stock_market_df, by = c("year", "month")) |>
  left_join(unemp_df, by = c("year", "month")) |> 
  arrange(year, month)
```

#### Explanation of datasets

###### Description of National Democratic and Republic Politician Dataset

To start with dataset **`pls_month_df`**, it contained information about
national politicians who are either democratic or republican across
across time. The dataset originally had the **`mon`** variable,
indicating the date of count, which I separated into columns **`year`**,
**`month`**, and **`day`** using the **`separate`** function. It also
had two variables, **`prez_gop`** and **`prez_dem`**, indicating whether
sitting president was republican or democratic on the associated date of
count, which I mutated into a new variable called **`president`**.After
tidying the dataset, the dataset was left with **822** observations and
**9** variables. The range of years for national politicians goes from
**1947** to **2015**, which tell us the year of observation. Along with
the **`year`** variable, we get more information from the **`month`**
and **`president`** variables, which also indicate the month of
observation and indication of whether the president was republican or
democratic at the time of observation.

###### Description of Standard & Poor’s Stock Market Index Dataset

###### Description of Unemployment Rate Dataset

###### Description of Merged Politician, Stock Market, and Unemployment Datasets

The range of years covered in the dataset, `pls_snp_unemp_df`, ranges
from **1947** to **2015**. It also contains **822** rows and **11**
columns. Key variables that are important to this dataset include the
`year`, `month`, `president`, `close`, and `unemp_rate` variables
